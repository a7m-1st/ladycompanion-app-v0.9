\n\nYou can decide at any stage if you would like a forensic medical examination. However, the sooner this takes place, the more chance of collecting evidence. If the assault occurred more than 7 days ago, it is still worth asking for advice from a SARC or the police about a forensic medical examination if you would like to have one.
\n\nUsually the doctor or nurse will take the samples, such as swabs from anywhere you have been kissed, touched or had anything inserted. They might also take urine and blood samples and occasionally hair, depending on the information you provide about the assault, and also retain some clothing and other items (if they do they will give you new clothes).
\n\nYou can ask to do your own swabs. Or you can choose to have only some samples, for example urine or clothing.
\n\nIt's important to have the swabs taken as soon as possible, as forensic evidence will wear and wash away.

\n\n - Respect their decisions â€“ for example, whether or not they want to report the assault to the police.
\n\n - Bear in mind they might not want to be touched. Even a hug might upset them, so ask first. If you're in a sexual relationship with them, be aware that sex might be frightening, and don't put pressure on them to have sex.
